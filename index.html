    <h1> Makeup Artist </h1>
    <p> When I sat down to watch Euphoria, I figured I’d be looking at a Gen Z-version of Skins—all drugs and teenage promiscuity, ripe for 15-year-olds to watch on their laptops when their parents think they’re asleep. But then I started watching and… The makeup. The makeup!!! Since the first episode, it’s all everyone’s been talking about. And while naysayers will point out that Euphoria’s makeup is too good to be realistic, seeing it reminded me quite a bit of the very real makeup I used to wear in high school.

In high school I was not cool and I hated everyone, save maybe five people. I wasn’t bullied—people either respected my particular brand of strangeness and left me alone, or had no idea who I was because I’d spend my free time in the art room bugging the teacher—but I wasn’t invited to parties, either. In lots of ways, the character on Euphoria I identify most with is Lexi. But my real-life high school style fell closer to that of Kat—I was into Hole and piercings, Ghost World and Daria, chokers that looked like dog collars and Ibsen plays and my boobs. I was really into being sad. I poured my heart out on a (secret, obviously) Tumblr site where I followed—in a weird, meta moment—Barbie Ferreira, a peripheral member of the Rookie clan I knew would become my best friend if I ever met her (she plays Kat on Euphoria now). I imagine the characters as Rookie girls, too—although Euphoria's lead makeup artist Doniella Davy told me that their Tumblrs might be filled with photos of Twiggy, Nina Simone, and ‘70s glam rock. A rare moment of truth-telling would reveal that maybe what I felt as shyness came off as standoffishness. Unlike Kat, I was a virgin, and would remain as such until after high school.

The way I interacted with beauty was informed by all of that. You know how they say to dance like no one’s watching? I used beauty like no one was watching, because I was pretty sure they weren’t. I dyed my hair lots of colors with Manic Panic (pink, blue, purple, red, black—my armpit hair was teal) and wore makeup that was either super goth or too, too saccharine. It usually wasn’t “pretty”—rather, I felt like it took me out of the matrix of pretty altogether. It was a blast! Then I got to college, saw a chance at normalcy, grabbed it, and stopped.

In Euphoria, Doniella uses makeup as a window to how the characters are feeling. “Makeup is emotionally evocative,” she told me, “and can express irony, playfulness, rebelliousness, joy, fearlessness, disorder, vulnerability, wanting to be loved, not wanting to be loved, delirium, elation, heartbreak, confusion, rebirth, surrealism, wonder, anxiety, and euphoria of course.” The expressiveness reminded me how intense feelings are when you’re a teen—years later, they still seem so vivid. “I wanted to create a euphoric version of reality through makeup,” Doniella said, “and use colors and textures that would be bold enough to hover above reality.</p>
